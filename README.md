# DeepLoki - Classification for Cleaning Images
Based on the Paper:  <br>
Data are not avaible. <br>
Implemented in Python using the PyTorch Framework<br>
We provide the code to enable you to to analyse/ classify Images in useful and trash  automatically and quickly.<br>
<br>
# Installation Guide
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

See https://github.com/rakro101/deeploki
'''
brew install python@3.10
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
'''
# Usage
<br>
The script always expects the following folder structure: train, test, val  and then the classes.
<br>
train_public_hpc.py - Script for Training a CNN form the list.
<br>
color_public_hpc.py - Use a trained CNN to classify & color the image patches.
<br>
To start the app just run the start_app.py
<br>
