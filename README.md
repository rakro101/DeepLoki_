ABSTRACT = {Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Early detection in primary and secondary locations is critical, but fraught with challenges. While digital pathology can assist with the classification of histopathological images, the training of such networks always relies on a ground truth, which is frequently compromised as tissue sections contain several types of tissue entities. Here we show that pancreatic cancer can be detected on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) sections by convolutional neural networks using deep transfer learning. To improve the ground truth, we describe a preprocessing data clean-up process using two communicators that were generated through existing and new datasets. Specifically, the communicators moved image tiles containing adipose tissue and background to a new data class. Hence, the original dataset exhibited improved labeling and, consequently, a higher ground truth accuracy. Deep transfer learning of a ResNet18 network resulted in a five-class accuracy of about 94% on test data images. The network was validated with independent tissue sections composed of healthy pancreatic tissue, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer lymph node metastases. The screening of different models and hyperparameter fine tuning were performed to optimize the performance with the independent tissue sections. Taken together, we introduce a step of data preprocessing via communicators as a means of improving the ground truth during deep transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning to identify pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma primary tumors and metastases in histological tissue sections.},
